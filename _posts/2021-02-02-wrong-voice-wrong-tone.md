Good UX writing is subtle and easy to overlook. Bad product writing is obvious.

I’m looking at a new connection’s profile on LinkedIn. This text has the voice and tone of a dating app, not a professional tool. Even if it were properly targeted at a recruiter, the intent is not “profiles anytime, anywhere”, it’s to make it easier to view the *right* profiles. The last thing anybody wants is a work app open “anytime, anywhere”.
