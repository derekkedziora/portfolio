This is a good [case study from Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/technical-writer-technology-adoption/) about having a technical writer at the center of a product launch. 

The technical writer clarified ideas from the start, which simplified the message and brought clarity of purpose to everyone involved. Most companies do the exact opposite and throw in a writer towards the end of product development. Then it’s already too late to tie up loose ends, unify messaging while providing internal and external clarity. Writers are just plugging leaks and putting out fires at that point. 

Getting the most out of content professionals requires focus and discipline from companies, which are often lacking in the frantic pace of product development, internal politics and general dismissiveness towards content and design from management&#x200a;—&#x200a;“just clean up the UI and throw some text on this button”.
